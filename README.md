### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a Software Development Engineer at Amazon, formerly a Propulsion Engineer at Boeing. I started my career at Boeing following my passion for the physical sciences. However, I have always been interested in computer science, and after 8 years at Boeing, I decided to make a career change. I decided to return to school to get a Master's in computer science, after which I started my computer science career at Amazon's MCF. I am currently enjoying the opportunity this work provides me to help businesses, both big and small, succeed - at the scale of Amazon.
