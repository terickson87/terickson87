### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a former Propulsion Engineer at Boeing and current MS Computer Science Student at USC with an expected graduation of December 2020. I have always been interested in compuster science, and made a decision to make a carrer change. I am excited to apply my 8 years of enterprise engineering experience, collaboration with project management and upper echelons of executive leadership, and leading teams of engineers I have had at Boeing and to follow my diverse passion for the many areas of computer science, from operating systems to React web applications, in an exciting new career.
